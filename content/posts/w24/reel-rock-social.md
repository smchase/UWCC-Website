Get ready for a movie night with UWCC as we watch Reel Rock 18 at Princess Cinemas on March 7th, 7 pm showtime. 

Join us afterwards too for our first Social of the term! After catching the movie, we’re heading to Kinton Ramen for dinner. 

🎥 Movie wraps around ~10:00 PM, but if you’re just up for the social, you’re more than welcome to join us there! Let’s make memories and share laughs over ramen. 🧗‍♂️
