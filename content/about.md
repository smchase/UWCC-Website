## What we do
We're the University of Waterloo's climbing community. Our goal is to get more people into climbing and provide opportunities for climbers to meet, climb together, and improve their skills. Everyone is welcome, from indoor boulderers to outdoor sport climbers, and from beginner to crusher. We run events, host competitions, and organize trips. We're the perfect place to meet new friends, progress in climbing, and have fun!

## Get involved
Our core activity is our weekly meetups, which are open to members and non-members alike. For special events and perks, you can learn more about [becoming a member](/membership). We also recruit execs every term to run the club, so if you have a vision and you're interested in helping out, stay tuned for announcements about applications.

For a quick overview of upcoming events, check out our [event calendar](/events). We also post about upcoming events on our [home page](/), [Instagram]({{% instagram_link %}}), and [Discord]({{% discord_link %}}). Our Discord is also a great place to connect with fellow climbers and make plans.

## Get in touch
If you have questions about anything, feel free to reach out to us on [Instagram]({{% instagram_link %}}) or [Discord]({{% discord_link %}}). You can also email us at [climbingclub.uwaterloo@gmail.com](mailto:climbingclub.uwaterloo@gmail.com) for more official inquiries.
